        "text":"Bitcoin sweeps through liquidity around $115,000 level, amid profit-taking and risk-off sentiment.\n\nEthereum rebounds from range low support above $3,500 amid steady ETF inflow.\n\nXRP upholds 100-period EMA support on the 4-hour chart, amid a persistent drop in Open Interest and funding rates.\n\nThe cryptocurrency market is striving for stability following a bearish wave during the Asian session on Friday, which saw Bitcoin (BTC) price slump to an intraday low of $114,723. A recovery is gaining momentum, with BTC exchanging hands at $115,868 at the time of writing, indicating interest in buying the dip could rise in upcoming sessions.\n\nLeading altcoins such as Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) are holding steadily above their respective key support levels. Ethereum bulls have been quick to grab the token near support at $3,500, boosting the price to $3,717 at the time of writing. The cross-border money remittance token, XRP, is trading above support at $3.00 after testing a low of $2.95 on Thursday.\n\nMarket overview: Bitcoin retreats amid possible market top and distribution\n\nThe Index Bitcoin Cycle Indicators (IBCI) has closed in on the distribution zone, a range known to reflect euphoria and possible market tops, now for the third time during the current BTC bull cycle, according to CryptoQuant.\n\n\"However, the index only touched the lower base of this zone, reaching the 80% mark, still a far way from the 100% that signaled major tops in previous BTC cycles,\" a CryptoQuant analyst highlighted on Thursday.\n\nThe IBCI level, as shown in the chart below, suggests that the market is in an expansion phase, but has not yet reached its maximum to indicate the end of the cycle. Moreover, aggressive profit-taking has not begun, hinting at the possibility of the bullish cycle extending.\n\n\"The IBCI is being 'held up' by a base of fundamentals that points to an absence of generalized euphoria. This suggests that there is still room for new highs before the market reaches a definitive end-of-cycle top,\" the analyst added.\n\nThe Index Bitcoin Cycle Indicators | Source: CryptoQuant\n\nA glance at the Altcoin Season Index suggests a pause in the altcoins' rally. CoinGlass data shows the index reversing to 43 after peaking at 59 on Monday, nearly three times the value of 20 on July 1. It is not the altcoin season until the index hits 75, indicating aggressive capital rotation from Bitcoin into other tokens.\n\nAltcoin Season Index | Source: CoinGlass\n\nData spotlight: Ethereum ETF inflow steady\n\nEthereum spot Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) continue to post steady inflows despite the headwinds in the crypto market. According to SoSoValue, investment products licensed in the United States (US) experienced a daily net inflow of $231 million on Thursday, which fell below Wednesday's capital inflow of $332 million. Currently, the total cumulative net inflow stands at $8.88 billion, with net assets averaging $20.7 billion.\n\nEthereum spot ETF data | Source | SoSOValue\n\nBitcoin spot ETFs recorded their first net inflow volume this week, at approximately $227 million on Thursday, signaling an improvement in sentiment. Suppose investors anticipate volatility in the US Dollar (USD) due to the implementation of President Donald Trump's higher tariffs on August 1. In that case, they will likely seek exposure to hedge assets like Bitcoin and Gold, thus keeping prices near the all-time high.\n\nBitcoin spot ETF data | Source | SoSOValue\n\nAs for XRP, interest in the token is dwindling following an impressive run-up to a new record high of $3.66. The Futures Open Interest (OI) chart below, which displays the notional value of futures and options contracts outstanding, shows a sharp correction from a yearly peak of $10.94 billion to $9.1 billion.\n\nIf the decline continues, it would indicate that sentiment and interest in XRP are declining, making it difficult for bulls to sustain the anticipated continuation of the uptrend.\n\nXRP Futures Open Interest | Source: CoinGlass\n\nChart of the Day: Bitcoin offers bearish signals\n\nBitcoin price has extended its decline after peaking at $120,090 on Wednesday. A support at $114,728 halted the down leg, paving the way for a minor reversal to $115,868 at the time of writing.\n\nDespite the reversal, the short-term outlook remains bearish, backed by a sell signal from the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator, which has been maintained since Thursday on the 4-hour chart.\n\nIf demand increases as investors buy the dip, the MACD indicator may recover toward the zero line, confirming a buy signal with the blue line crossing above the red signal line.\n\nKey areas of interest to traders would be the 100-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $116,461 and the 50-period EMA at $117,843. The 200-period EMA at $113,520 is in line to provide support if the decline resumes.\n\nBTC\/USDT 4-hour chart\n\nAltcoins update: Ethereum approaches breakout\n\nEthereum price is getting closer to another breakout after rebounding from support near $3,500. The 4-hour chart below shows ETH price testing the trendline resistance, which, if broken, could encourage risk-on sentiment and boost the uptrend toward the $4,000 milestone.\n\nIn the event of a reversal, the 50-period EMA at $3,575 will serve as the first key support. However, if the decline extends, the 100-period EMA at $3,351 and the 200-period EMA at $3,065 will come into play to absorb the selling pressure.\n\nETH\/USDT 4-hour chart\n\nAs for XRP, a recovery is underway above the support level at $3.07, provided by the 100-period EMA on the 4-hour chart. A steady upward trend in the price could result in a buy signal from the MACD indicator, prompting traders to seek exposure. Hence, there's a need for traders to watch out for the blue MACD line crossing above the red signal line.\n\nXRP\/USDT 4-hour chart\n\nDespite an improving short-term technical picture, XRP fundamentals show weakness, particularly in the futures Open Interest and funding rates, which have retreated over the last few days. That said, it could be premature to rule out a correction below the $3.07 support, which could expand the bearish scope to the 200-period EMA at $2.80, tested on July 15.\n\nCryptocurrency metrics FAQs What is circulating supply? The developer or creator of each cryptocurrency decides on the total number of tokens that can be minted or issued. Only a certain number of these assets can be minted by mining, staking or other mechanisms. This is defined by the algorithm of the underlying blockchain technology. On the other hand, circulating supply can also be decreased via actions such as burning tokens, or mistakenly sending assets to addresses of other incompatible blockchains. What is market capitalization? Market capitalization is the result of multiplying the circulating supply of a certain asset by the asset’s current market value. What is trading volume? Trading volume refers to the total number of tokens for a specific asset that has been transacted or exchanged between buyers and sellers within set trading hours, for example, 24 hours. It is used to gauge market sentiment, this metric combines all volumes on centralized exchanges and decentralized exchanges. Increasing trading volume often denotes the demand for a certain asset as more people are buying and selling the cryptocurrency. What is the funding rate? Funding rates are a concept designed to encourage traders to take positions and ensure perpetual contract prices match spot markets. It defines a mechanism by exchanges to ensure that future prices and index prices periodic payments regularly converge. When the funding rate is positive, the price of the perpetual contract is higher than the mark price. This means traders who are bullish and have opened long positions pay traders who are in short positions. On the other hand, a negative funding rate means perpetual prices are below the mark price, and hence traders with short positions pay traders who have opened long positions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "text":"IBM stock gets slammed after reporting positive Q2 result.\n\nRevenue beat forecasts by $385 million as infrastructure revenue rose 14% YoY.\n\nAnalysts largely take positive view of IBM despite market sell-off.\n\nIBM stock performance takes Dow Jones down with it.\n\nInternational Business Machines (IBM) stock has lost much of its recent rally on Thursday after the market sold the legacy tech giant with shares down 10% at the time of writing. After closing on Wednesday near $282, IBM stock has traded as low as $254 on Thursday morning.\n\nIt's difficult to surmise why the market is so repulsed by the sizable top and bottom line earnings beat, but the tweet below is at least part of the story.\n\nWall Street analysts have been largely impressed by the quarterly result as well. JPMorgan raised its price target on IBM stock from $244 to $290, while the overly bearish UBS grudgingly raised it from $195 to $200. Bank of America Securities cut its price target from $320 to $310, which still shows serious belief in the company at the current share price.\n\nThe only complaint from analyst seems to be that IBM's gains are largely from cyclical segments of its business that do not buffer the valuation.\n\nIBM's travails have sent the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) down by 0.35% at the time of writing, while the S&P 500 and NASDAQ are narrowly higher. Following both of their post-market earnings releases on Wednesday, Tesla (TSLA) shares shot down 9% at the Thursday open, while Alphabet (GOOGL) shares have gained ground.\n\nIBM earnings news\n\nIBM reported adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $2.80, which was 15 cents better than the Wall Street consensus. Revenue of $17 billion also rose nearly 8% YoY to come in $385 million above the average analyst prediction.\n\nWith the US Dollar declining sharply this year, IBM said that exchange rates were expected to add 1.5 percentage points to revenue growth for the full year, and all segments in Q2 performed noticeably better due to exchange rates. Revenue growth for full-year 2025 was guided for just 5% growth in constant currency terms, which might also be part of the negative sentiment story from the market.\n\nIBM's gross profit margin in GAAP terms rose by 200 basis points to 58.8% in the quarter, while its adjusted operating margin rose 230 basis points to 60.1%. Management now expects $13.5 billion in free cash flow for the year.\n\nCEO Arvind Krishna said the company's generative AI business has had bookings increase from $6 billion in Q1 to $7.5 billion in Q2. Software sales rose 10% YoY to $7.39 billion but arrived $100 million behind forecasts. Infrastructure revenue rose 14%, while consulting revenue rose 3% and was actually flat on a constant currency basis.\n\n\"The innovation we are bringing to market across the portfolio continues to resonate with clients as they scale their AI adoption and investments. As a result, revenue growth, portfolio mix and ongoing productivity initiatives drove significant margin expansion and double-digit profit growth,\" said James Kavanaugh, IBM's senior vice president and CFO. \"This combination delivered solid free cash flow, fueling our ability to invest in the business and return value to shareholders through dividends.\"\n\nIBM stock chart\n\nIBM stock broke through support provided by the May-June basing period near $258 but has recovered to near that level. Further support can be found at the 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) near $245.40, as well as the long-term resistance-turned-support band that surrounds the $240 level (highlighted in light blue).\n\nWith the Relative Strength Index (RSI) getting slammed down to 26, some buyers will be interested, but most will wait for a consolidation period near one of the lower supportive structures.\n\nIBM daily stock chart\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "text":"Vancouver, Canada, British Columbia, July 23rd, 2025, FinanceWire\n\nPayop, an international payment service provider, has partnered with Dragonpay, a Philippine-based payment platform, to enhance the online operations experience for businesses and consumers in Southeast Asia.\n\nThis collaboration perfectly illustrates the evolving Philippine digital payments landscape, where e-wallets are gaining popularity alongside well-established cash-based methods. With Dragonpay offering multiple payment options, Payop can grant its clients access to all segments of consumers in the region.\n\nWhy This Partnership Matters\n\nDespite the growing penetration of digital payments, cash remains king for many Filipinos, particularly in rural areas. However, the trend is shifting as more consumers embrace online banking, mobile wallets, and other electronic payment methods, driven by convenience, security, and the expanding digital infrastructure.\n\nAccording to Statista Research Department, cash was chosen as the most preferred method by 94% of respondents, with e-wallets and online card payments reaching 64% and 52%, respectively. This shows that while many continue to choose cash methods out of habit, a significant segment of the population is becoming tech-savvy, leading to the gradual rooting of digital payment methods.\n\nLast year, the number of digital payment users reached 33,85 million, with e-commerce accounting for 99,5%. And that number will continue to grow. So, implementing multiple payment options is key to staying on top of the wave when doing business in this market.\n\nPayop: Simple and Reliable Payments, Worldwide\n\nPayop, an international payment service provider, has been at the forefront of facilitating simple online transactions for businesses worldwide for six years. The company is constantly expanding its arsenal of payment methods, including the Philippines, to give merchants convenient access to this market. Payop aims to bridge the gap between businesses and consumers by providing an extensive range of payment methods, ensuring inclusivity and accessibility for all users.\n\nAnastasiia Semenkova, CEO at Payop, highlighted the strategic importance of the partnership with Dragonpay for business development in the Philippine market:\n\n“International e-commerce websites have previously focused on card payments for their expansion strategies, overlooking the potential to engage consumers who prefer alternative payment methods for everyday transactions. Our collaboration with Dragonpay not only enhances the payment experience for Filipino customers but also plays a crucial role in advancing financial inclusion in the region. Online shopping is now more convenient than ever. Dragonpay's solution integrates all major banks and e-wallets, allowing local shoppers to pay using their familiar methods at Payop checkout. We value their reliability and payment expertise.”\n\nDragonpay Founder and CEO, Robertson Chiang, added:\n\n“Our collaboration with Payop enables us to provide a seamless and comprehensive payment experience to a broader range of consumers. By combining our local expertise with Payop's international presence, we are confident that we can further enhance the accessibility and convenience of digital payments in the region, ultimately driving financial inclusion and growth.”\n\nAbout Dragonpay\n\nEstablished in 2010, Dragonpay is the pioneer in alternative online payments in the Philippines, empowering businesses of all sizes to accept and disburse payments through secure and convenient channels, giving their customers the flexibility to choose the payment method that’s right for them. Today, Dragonpay is partnered with over 3,500* merchants, and 85* payment channels with 35,500* branches nationwide and has processed over 400* million transactions for online Filipinos globally.\n\nFor more details, users can visit https:\/\/dragonpay.ph.\n\n*Numbers may fluctuate\n\nAbout Payop\n\nPayop is a global payment service provider that helps businesses accept and manage online payments securely across borders.
