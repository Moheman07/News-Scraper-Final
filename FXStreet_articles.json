        "text":"\n\n\n\nAmerica's August 1 deadline to strike trade deals or slap tariffs looms.\n\nThe Fed is set to leave interest rates unchanged, fending off immense pressure.\n\nEconomists expect Nonfarm Payrolls to remain robust\n\n\"No rest for the wicked\" – not even in the middle of summer. This week is packed with top-tier macroeconomic events that are set to rock markets.\n\n1) Trade deadline may result in some jitters\n\nThe US and the EU agreed to a trade agreement, following in the footsteps of the US-Japan deal, with a 15% tariff on most goods. After these accords with major countries and as Sino-American trade will likely remain in a state of truce.\n\nAs with other accords, many details, such as sector-specific duties and also purchases of US goods by other countries, remain unclear. That means there will be bumps in the road for existing deals, but these further twists are more likely to occur beyond this week.\n\nWhat is highly probable this week is news of further accords with other countries or that US President Donald Trump slaps heavy duties on them. The countries to watch are India and South Korea – both are big trading partners with which the US has yet to make progress with.\n\nInvestors will cheer deals or delays, but will suffer if Trump slams them with prohibitive duties. What is prohibitive? The EU and Japan agreed to 15%, while Vietnam, Indonesia and the Philippines settled for 19% or 20%. Anything above 20% on a significant trading partner would be worrisome.\n\n2) ADP jobs data could be disregarded as pessimistic\n\nWednesday, 12:15 GMT. America's largest payroll provider publishes a leading indicator toward the official Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) report. But does Automatic Data Processing’s (ADP) private-sector jobs report really indicate something?\n\nThe past few publications have proven extremely pessimistic, especially the most recent one, which pointed to job losses.\n\nI expect investors to be skeptical of any downbeat figure, seeing it as \"the boy who cried wolf.\" Conversely, a robust outcome would be treated as a bullish sign. The thinking might go: ADP is optimistic, the NFP will be even better.\n\nIn any case, expect a short-lived effect on markets ahead of the Federal Reserve (Fed).\n\n3) US GDP will likely show steady growth is back\n\nWednesday, 12:30 GMT. Did US economic data return to normal? Gross Domestic Product (GDP) figures for the first quarter of 2025 showed negative growth – a result of massive imports of goods ahead of tariffs. There was an outsized role for shipments of Gold to American shores.\n\nEconomists expect a return to normalcy in figures for the second quarter. The initial release, which is the most impactful on markets, is projected to show an annualized expansion rate of 2.5%, a bounce from -0.5% in Q1.\n\nAn outcome above 3% would be bullish for Stocks and the US Dollar (USD), while bearish for Gold. Another reading below 2% would have the opposite effect. Also here, it is essential to note that prices may return to pre-release ranges quickly, given the upcoming Fed decision.\n\n4) Fed decision could include cold water on many cuts, but also some dissent\n\nWednesday, decision at 18:00 GMT, press conference at 18:30 GMT. Will the Fed cut interest rates in September? That is one question investors have on their minds for this July decision, in which the world's most powerful central bank is set to leave borrowing costs unchanged.\n\nFed Chair Jerome Powell will likely leave his options open for September, as there are two more inflation reports and also a couple of jobs figures due before then. Moreover, the Chair and his colleagues want to see the impact of tariffs on price rises. So far, the impact has been minimal, but they could begin showing soon.\n\nPowell will have to be cautious when talking about inflation, especially after fact-checking Trump in the Fed's building on Thursday. The relationship is extremely tense.\n\nWhat about Fed members who were nominated by Trump in his first term? Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman turned dovish a few months ago, supporting earlier rate cuts. If both vote to cut rates, markets could see it as a sign the bank will cut next time, perhaps even by 50 basis points (bps).\n\nMy baseline scenario is for both Bowman and Waller to opt for a cut – a rare double dissent – thus triggering a rally in markets. However, Powell may then pour some cold water with some caution – and a refusal to commit. That would reverse the trend, at least temporarily.\n\n5) BoJ set to intensify talk of a rate hike\n\nThursday, early in the Asian session. The Bank of Japan (BoJ) is set to leave borrowing costs unchanged once again. The Tokyo-based institution has pledged to raise interest rates to curb inflation, but after lifting it from negative territory to 0.50%, it is taking a long pause.\n\nAnother rate hike seemed elusive until the US and Japan struck a trade deal last week, providing some certainty to policymakers. That may embolden BoJ Governor Kazuo Ueda to signal a hike is coming sooner than markets think.\n\nI expect the Japanese Yen (JPY) to emerge stronger from the meeting, assuming Ueda sounds somewhat more hawkish.\n\n6) Core PCE could vindicate Fed hawks\n\nThursday, 12:30 GMT. The day between the Fed and Nonfarm Payrolls is not very quiet. Apart from weekly Initial Jobless Claims, which do not include the time when NFP surveys are conducted, there is a more interesting publication.\n\nThe core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index is the Fed's preferred gauge of inflation. After a few months of subdued outcomes, the economic calendar points to an increase of 0.3% MoM in June, accelerating from 0.2% in the previous month.\n\nA faster increase may push the annual figure away from its long-term descent toward 2%, the central bank's target, and vindicate Fed hawks who fear tariffs may have an adverse impact on inflation.\n\n7) Nonfarm Payrolls could defy AI and tariffs once again\n\nFriday, 12:30 GMT. Has Artificial Intelligence (AI) hurt the labor market? So far, certain jobs, such as entry-level programmers, have suffered, but overall employment holds up. Has a tough stance against illegal immigrants resulted in more positions for the native-born population or weakened the entire labor market? What about tariffs?\n\nThese remain open questions – but the Nonfarm Payrolls report for July could provide some answers. The economic calendar points to an increase of 102K positions, somewhat lower than in previous months, but still growing.\n\nAn upbeat outcome would boost the US Dollar and weigh on Gold, while signs of weakness would do the opposite. What about Stocks? Companies need employed people to sell their products to, but also fear high interest rates. I think investors will prefer strong data over weak data.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nThis is one of the busiest weeks of the year, featuring not only Trump's headline-grabbing comments but also a dense concentration of top-tier economic figures. Trade with care.\n\n\n\n",

        "text":"IBM stock gets slammed after reporting positive Q2 result.\n\nRevenue beat forecasts by $385 million as infrastructure revenue rose 14% YoY.\n\nAnalysts largely take positive view of IBM despite market sell-off.\n\nIBM stock performance takes Dow Jones down with it.\n\nInternational Business Machines (IBM) stock has lost much of its recent rally on Thursday after the market sold the legacy tech giant with shares down 10% at the time of writing. After closing on Wednesday near $282, IBM stock has traded as low as $254 on Thursday morning.\n\nIt's difficult to surmise why the market is so repulsed by the sizable top and bottom line earnings beat, but the tweet below is at least part of the story.\n\nWall Street analysts have been largely impressed by the quarterly result as well. JPMorgan raised its price target on IBM stock from $244 to $290, while the overly bearish UBS grudgingly raised it from $195 to $200. Bank of America Securities cut its price target from $320 to $310, which still shows serious belief in the company at the current share price.\n\nThe only complaint from analyst seems to be that IBM's gains are largely from cyclical segments of its business that do not buffer the valuation.\n\nIBM's travails have sent the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) down by 0.35% at the time of writing, while the S&P 500 and NASDAQ are narrowly higher. Following both of their post-market earnings releases on Wednesday, Tesla (TSLA) shares shot down 9% at the Thursday open, while Alphabet (GOOGL) shares have gained ground.\n\nIBM earnings news\n\nIBM reported adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $2.80, which was 15 cents better than the Wall Street consensus. Revenue of $17 billion also rose nearly 8% YoY to come in $385 million above the average analyst prediction.\n\nWith the US Dollar declining sharply this year, IBM said that exchange rates were expected to add 1.5 percentage points to revenue growth for the full year, and all segments in Q2 performed noticeably better due to exchange rates. Revenue growth for full-year 2025 was guided for just 5% growth in constant currency terms, which might also be part of the negative sentiment story from the market.\n\nIBM's gross profit margin in GAAP terms rose by 200 basis points to 58.8% in the quarter, while its adjusted operating margin rose 230 basis points to 60.1%. Management now expects $13.5 billion in free cash flow for the year.\n\nCEO Arvind Krishna said the company's generative AI business has had bookings increase from $6 billion in Q1 to $7.5 billion in Q2. Software sales rose 10% YoY to $7.39 billion but arrived $100 million behind forecasts. Infrastructure revenue rose 14%, while consulting revenue rose 3% and was actually flat on a constant currency basis.\n\n\"The innovation we are bringing to market across the portfolio continues to resonate with clients as they scale their AI adoption and investments. As a result, revenue growth, portfolio mix and ongoing productivity initiatives drove significant margin expansion and double-digit profit growth,\" said James Kavanaugh, IBM's senior vice president and CFO. \"This combination delivered solid free cash flow, fueling our ability to invest in the business and return value to shareholders through dividends.\"\n\nIBM stock chart\n\nIBM stock broke through support provided by the May-June basing period near $258 but has recovered to near that level. Further support can be found at the 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) near $245.40, as well as the long-term resistance-turned-support band that surrounds the $240 level (highlighted in light blue).\n\nWith the Relative Strength Index (RSI) getting slammed down to 26, some buyers will be interested, but most will wait for a consolidation period near one of the lower supportive structures.\n\nIBM daily stock chart\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "authors":"",
        "publish_date":"2025-07-28 09:17:59+00:00",
        "text":"Instruments come and go in the CFD space, but few redefine the trading environment. The introduction of synthetic indices by TopFX may be one of those moments. This product introduces a fundamentally different way to interact with the market, one that strips out noise, detaches from external events, and gives traders an uninterrupted, technically driven landscape.\n\nWith this launch on TopFX website, the company is expanding its asset list. The firm now offers a toolset that is structurally distinct from traditional CFDs. And in doing so, it is addressing long-standing trader with news-driven volatility, weekend gaps, and unpredictable price behavior. For many, this release marks a departure from reactive forex trading altogether.\n\nWhat Are Synthetic Indices and Why Do They Matter\n\nSynthetic indices are algorithmically generated instruments designed to simulate real market behavior without being tied to physical assets currencies, commodities, or equities. They operate on mathematical models, which means there is no influence from central bank policies, earnings reports, or political headlines. This independence from real-world triggers is what sets them apart.\n\nFor traders, this creates a uniquely stable environment. Synthetic indices run 24\/7, including weekends, with no gaps caused by market openings or closings. Volatility is part of the design, but it is predictable in nature. Traders know the type of movement to expect and can build strategies that are not constantly disrupted by external surprises.\n\nIn today’s trading landscape, where a single tweet or data release can ruin a well-planned position, synthetic indices offer clarity. They are especially useful for short-term traders, high-frequency models, and anyone relying on pattern recognition or statistical setups. For those asking how to trade synthetic indices, it starts with shifting focus from news interpretation to pure price structure.\n\nThis stripped-back form of forex trading eliminates much of the noise, making it ideal for those using automation tools or back-tested strategies. The predictability of synthetic pricing brings a rare level of confidence to technical execution, something that traditional markets often can't guarantee.\n\nWhy TopFX Stepped In\n\nThe move by TopFX to introduce synthetic indices facilitates traders who are looking for more consistent market conditions. In a recent announcement by TopFX, CEO Victor Zachariades made clear that the goal was to help traders escape the noise of constant headlines.\n\nIn a market where many brokers are hesitant to introduce non-traditional instruments, the firm has taken this more confident, transparent route.\n\nTopFX, by contrast, has made these instruments available to all clients within its regulated ecosystem and through the widely used cTrader platform. There are no hidden portals, special permissions, or experimental trading environments. The company offers synthetic indices with continuous 24\/7 uptime, algorithmically balanced pricing, and full integration into the same execution engine used for forex, commodities, and indices. This level of open, reliable access is still uncommon in the multi-asset brokerage space.\n\nThis launch also comes as the company marks its 15-year anniversary, a significant milestone in this field. TopFX began as a liquidity solutions provider in 2010 and gradually transitioned into a regulated, multi-asset brokerage. That long development arc has enabled the company to shape offerings based on observed trader behavior rather than marketing cycles. The result is an ecosystem that supports both speculative retail traders and institutional trading operations with equal care.\n\nFor prop firms, algo developers, and active retail traders, this setup offers something rare: a consistent, distortion-free space where strategy drives results. And as more providers move toward integrated forex trading solutions, TopFX is already positioned with a forward-looking approach that reflects how traders operate.\n\nIllustration of a trading candlestick chart\n\nThe Bigger Picture: A New Kind of Control\n\nFrom a broader industry view, this may be one of the clearest moves toward giving traders greater independence. In a market filled with overlapping influences, from inflation numbers to monetary policy updates to unexpected tweets, the ability to work with instruments that move independently of all that feels significant.\n\nIt is not that synthetic indices replace traditional products. Rather, they exist as an alternative. They offer a clean chart, algorithmic structure, and uninterrupted access. In environments where control is elusive, they return a degree of balance to the process.\n\nFor traders at all levels, this presents an opportunity to explore markets with fewer outside variables. That includes newcomers still learning technical strategy and experienced professionals refining edge cases in automation. This product is not a shortcut, but it simplifies the inputs. Its simplicity even aligns with evolving trading technology trends where structure is prioritized over speculation.\n\nWhy This Feels Like a Shift\n\nTopFX’s decision to include synthetic trading signifies their commitment to equipping traders with tools that reflect how they actually trade. From liquidity solutions to integrated analysis platforms like Autochartist and Trading Central, the company has consistently invested in structure over flash.\n\nFifteen years in, TopFX has chosen to focus less on expanding volume and more on expanding relevance. Synthetic trading is part of that strategy. It adds another layer to the firm’s multi-asset offering without complicating the user experience. In an industry steadily adapting to user-focused evolution, TopFX shows that adaptation does not mean dilution. It is rare for a product to reshape how traders approach the market, but this one may quietly do exactly that.",

        "text":"As the Federal Reserve (Fed) prepares to hold interest rates steady at its July 30 meeting, American savers need more than ever to understand how the central bank's moves affect their retirement plans, particularly Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs).\n\nThe Fed's interest rates and retirement planning\n\nThe Fed plays a central role in the financial lives of Americans. By adjusting its key interest rates, it influences the cost of credit, returns on savings and the evolution of financial markets.\n\nWhile these mechanisms may seem abstract, their impact on your retirement planning, and in particular your IRA, is real.\n\nWhen the Fed raises interest rates, borrowing becomes more expensive, which may slow the economy but improve returns on variable-rate savings accounts or new Bonds.\n\nConversely, lower interest rates stimulate economic growth by making money cheaper, but reduce interest income for savers.\n\nIRAs: Why Fed interest rates matter\n\nIndividual Retirement Accounts are powerful tools for building a solid retirement. Whether Traditional or Roth , they allow savings to grow tax-free (or tax-deferred).\n\nBut their performance depends largely on the economic environment, and therefore on the Fed's decisions.\n\nWhen interest rates rise, Bond funds held in an IRA may lose value in the short term. However, over the longer term, these funds will gradually integrate higher-rate Bonds, which can improve the income generated by the portfolio.\n\nWhen interest rates fall, equities tend to perform better, as companies can borrow more cheaply to finance their growth. This can boost the valuation of equity-oriented IRA portfolios .\n\nThe current situation: A cautious Fed on the verge of action\n\nCurrently, the Fed is maintaining rates between 4.25% and 4.5% since December, a historically high level.\n\nFed interest rates. Source: FXStreet\n\nAlthough inflation is stabilizing, the uncertainties associated with the tariffs imposed by the US President Donald Trump administration are prompting Fed policymakers to remain cautious.\n\nHowever, markets are anticipating a first rate cut as early as September, if the next employment and inflation reports confirm an economic slowdown.\n\nTarget Rate Probabilities for the September meeting. Source: CME Group\n\nFor savers, this means that the cycle of interest rate cuts paused this year could soon resume, with concrete consequences for IRAs.\n\nHow to adapt your IRA strategy in this context\n\nReassess the Bond portion of your portfolio\n\nIf you hold Bonds via funds in your IRA, monitor their sensitivity to interest rates (duration).\n\nIn a context of falling interest rates, these assets may see their value rise. You could also consider extending duration or incorporating high-yield Bonds, with discretion.\n\nExplore rate-sensitive stocks and sectors\n\nSectors such as Real Estate , Technology and Utilities can benefit from a low-rate environment.\n\nDividends from certain stocks can also offer an interesting alternative to Bond income in your IRA.\n\nStay diversified and aligned with your retirement horizon\n\nIt's tempting to adjust your portfolio with every Fed move, but your retirement planning strategy must remain consistent with your long-term goals.\n\nDiversifying your IRA account between Equities, Bonds, cash and, where appropriate, Commodities remains key.\n\nConsider the tax impact of distributions\n\nIf you're close to the age of Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs) , a drop in interest rates could affect your future income.\n\nPlan ahead to avoid forced withdrawals during unfavorable market conditions.\n\nFollow the Fed, but don't panic\n\nThe Federal Reserve's movements have a profound influence on the economy and the markets, and therefore on your Individual Retirement Accounts.\n\nBut rather than reacting impulsively to every interest rate decision, the most prudent approach remains to follow a diversified strategy, rebalance your portfolio regularly and stay aligned with your retirement planning goals.\n\nIf interest rates fall soon, this could be an opportunity to boost your retirement savings. Provided you're prepared.",

The pair faced challenges as the US Dollar (USD) rose on trade optimism, driven by the trade deal between the United States (US) and the European Union (EU).\n\nThe US and EU reached a framework trade agreement on Sunday that sets 15% tariffs on most European goods, taking effect on August 1. This deal has ended a months-long stand-off, per Bloomberg.\n\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on Sunday that the bloc agreed not to impose retaliatory tariffs and pledged $600 billion in investment in the US on top of existing expenditures.\n\nEuropean Central Bank (ECB) policymaker Peter Kazimir said on Monday that there is \"no significant change\" compelling him to act in September, noting that it would require \"clear signs of a deterioration in the labor market\" to prompt a move. Kazimir acknowledged that the US-EU trade deal has reduced uncertainty, though its impact on inflation remains unclear.\n\nFrance condemned on Monday, stating that the framework trade agreement was a \"dark day\" for Europe, arguing that the bloc had capitulated to US President Donald Trump by accepting an unbalanced deal that imposed a headline 15% tariff on EU goods. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz warned that the agreed tariffs would cause \"significant\" damage to his country's economy.",

        "text":"Despite the bullish tariff news, EUR\/USD remains inside a rising wedge pattern on both the weekly and daily timeframes. It is currently stalling beneath a major volume resistance zone.\n\nThe recent trade agreement between the US and EU — which reduced previously threatened tariffs to 15% — gave the euro a brief boost. However, price action hasn’t confirmed any true breakout yet.\n\nWhile the technical structure remains bullish, momentum is visibly waning, and EUR\/USD is struggling to push through the top of a rising channel and a volume resistance zone ($1.178 — $1.194).\n\nThe key takeaway from here is this:\n\nEUR\/USD technicals are short term bearish.\n\nHowever, fundamentals point to a mid term bullish EUR\/USD.\n\nIt’ll all come down to the euro-dollar asset confirming a direction via price action.\n\nTechnical analysis of EUR\/USD (late July 2025)\n\nWeekly view — Rising channel and critical zones\n\nSince the start of 2021, EUR\/USD has fallen from the $1.20 region to a low near $0.98, briefly hitting parity in 2022.\n\nBut since that bottom, the pair has staged an impressive recovery — climbing back toward the $1.178 area, now just a few cents away from its 4-year high.\n\nThat said, price is currently stalling at the $1.178 range, which lines up precisely with the top of a rising channel on the weekly chart. If bulls want to push higher, this zone must be broken convincingly.\n\nKey volume-based zones (last 4 years)\n\nImmediate resistance: $1.178 – $1.194\n\n$1.178 – $1.194 Major resistance (4-year high): $1.209 – $1.2176\n\n$1.209 – $1.2176 Immediate support: $1.155 – $1.161\n\n$1.155 – $1.161 Lower support: $1.126 – $1.134\n\n$1.126 – $1.134 Critical support (point of control): $1.0816 – $1.0896\n\nRSI context\n\nThe RSI has been climbing steadily throughout 2025, reflecting strong bullish momentum — but also signalling the risk of exhaustion. It has now tapped into overbought territory twice this year, with the most recent move forming a bearish RSI failure swing.\n\nThat’s often seen as a warning sign for bulls and can precede a retracement.\n\nDaily view — Rising wedge and anchored vWAP support\n\nOn the daily chart, EUR\/USD has rejected the top of a rising channel, giving shape to a rising wedge — a bearish pattern often seen before reversals, especially when price begins compressing like this.\n\nPrice is now testing the lower wedge trendline, with $1.155–$1.161 as the first support. If that breaks, watch $1.126–$1.134, a stronger zone that aligns with the anchored vWAP from March 2025 — a key level marking the average price of this rally.\n\nShould this zone give way, the next target is $1.0816–$1.0896, the point of control since 2021. That would mark a deeper pullback, approaching parity levels; though this outcome seems less likely for now.\n\nBottom line\n\nWith the market still pricing in a Fed rate cut in September and midterm fundamentals supporting the euro, this may just be a short-term correction in an overall bullish trend.",

        "text":"EUR\/USD deepened its retracement, breaching below the 1.1600 support.\n\nThe US Dollar picked up strong upside impulse following the US-EU trade deal.\n\nFocus remains on trade, the upcoming Fed meeting, and key US NFP.\n\nThe Euro has accelerated its downward momentum vs. the US Dollar (USD) on Monday, sending EUR\/USD south of the 1.1600 support to hit new two-week troughs. The pullback came as the Greenback found its footing again, nudging the Dollar Index (DXY) well north of the 98.00 hurdle.\n\nA Dollar lift on mixed signals and central bank drama\n\nMost of the Dollar’s support came from rising optimism over trade negotiations, particularly in response to the US-EU trade agreement clinched over the weekend.\n\nIn fact, both countries have settled on a 15% tariff for most EU exports into the US—up from the 10% rate set in April and a far cry from the 30% levy that had been on the table, but still above the pre‑Trump level of about 1.2%.\n\nIn addition, certain industries get a full tariff holiday: think aircraft and parts, semiconductors, chemicals, and key agricultural products will sail in duty‑free.\n\nHowever, those hefty steel and aluminium duties aren’t budging—US import levies remain at 50%.\n\nIn return, the EU has pledged to purchase $750 billion worth of American energy over the coming years, buy “vast amounts” of military kit, and boost its investment in the US by more than $600 billion beyond today’s levels.\n\nThe ongoing trade optimism seems to have placed the Fed-White House clash issue on the back burner, albeit momentarily. It is worth recalling that a surprise visit by President Trump to the Federal Reserve last Thursday stirred fresh concerns over central bank independence, just as investors try to parse the Fed’s next move.\n\nCentral banks enter the “pause mode”\n\nMinutes from June’s FOMC meeting show a split Committee: some members support preemptive cuts, while others favour waiting to see whether tariff-induced inflation proves sticky. A firmer June CPI reading supports Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s cautious approach, even as futures traders continue to pencil in some easing later this year. At Wednesday’s FOMC event, consensus points to another “hold” by the Committee.\n\nAcross the Atlantic, the European Central Bank (ECB) struck a more optimistic tone. Interest rates were left unchanged, and President Christine Lagarde declared the eurozone economy to be in “a good place,” with growth either on track or “a little bit better.” That was enough to make markets rethink their dovish bets—traders who once saw a rate cut this autumn now see only an 80% chance of a move, possibly delayed until next spring.\n\nSpeculators go long, commercials go short\n\nLast week saw speculators take a step back on the euro as CFTC data for July 22 shows net long bets sliding to about 125.5K contracts, the weakest in two weeks. At the same time, commercial hedgers trimmed their net shorts to roughly 177.7K contracts, also a two‑week low. Yet overall market engagement remains high: open interest climbed for the fifth straight week, nearing 843.5K contracts.\n\nTechnical landscape\n\nEUR\/USD faces stiff resistance at the YTD high of 1.1830 (July 1). A break above that could open the door to the September 2021 peak at 1.1909 (September 3), and potentially the symbolic 1.2000 mark.\n\nOn the downside, the July low of 1.1556 (July 17) offers near-term support. Below that, the 55-day simple moving average (SMA) at 1.1528 comes into view, followed by the weekly base at 1.1210 (May 29) and the May valley at 1.1064 (May 12).\n\nMomentum remains cautious. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) fell below 45, suggesting room for extra losses, but the Average Directional Index (ADX) sits below 21, pointing to a trend that hasn’t yet found real conviction.\n\nEUR\/USD daily chart\n\nThe bigger picture\n\nThe pair’s recent climb has been more grind than gallop, unfolding in the shadow of unresolved trade tensions and diverging central bank signals. A dovish pivot from the Fed—or signs of a cooling trade war—could push EUR\/USD toward fresh highs.",
