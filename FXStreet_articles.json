        "text":"Tiff Macklem, Governor of the Bank of Canada, answered reporters' questions on the central bank's policy outlook. This followed the recent BoC's decision to keep its policy rate at 2.75%, which was largely anticipated by the market.\n\n\n\n\n\nBoC press conference key highlights\n\nWe see signs of underlying upside pressure on inflation.\n\nThe US trade policy remains unpredictable.\n\nWe're looking at a shorter horizon than usual.\n\nThe Canadian economy is showing signs of resilience.\n\nStrong core measures of inflation have gotten our attention.\n\nSome of the factors that may be causing that increase in core inflation should unwind.\n\nIt's hard to be as forward-looking as usual when you've got an unusual amount of uncertainty.\n\nWe'll take rate decisions one at a time; the situation hasn't changed that much since the last decision.\n\nConsumption is growing modestly; we expect the trend to continue in Q3 and Q4.\n\nNeed to set policy considering tariff risks.\n\nSad reality is that tariffs mean the economy is going to work less efficiently; there is going to be less income.\n\nWe are going to make sure that a tariff problem doesn't become an inflation problem.\n\nThis section below was published at 13:45 GMT to cover the Bank of Canada's policy announcements and the initial market reaction.\n\nIn line with market analysts’ expectations, the Bank of Canada held its policy rate steady at 2.75% on Wednesday.\n\nBoC's policy statement highlights\n\nThe Bank of Canada monetary policy report does not provide economic forecasts and cites uncertainty generated by US tariffs.\n\nRisk of a severe and escalating global trade conflict has diminished since April.\n\nReleases a current tariffs scenario as well as two alternative scenarios, one with increased and another with decreased tariffs.\n\nIn the current tariff scenario, GDP grows by about 1% in the second half of 2025 and then picks up, hitting 1.8% in 2027; inflation stays close to 2% over the scenario horizon.\n\nIn the de-escalation scenario, GDP grows around 2% in the second half of 2025 and then averages around 1.7% through the end of 2027; inflation falls in Q1 2026 before rising to close to 2% in 2027.\n\nIn the escalation scenario, growth falls in 2025 before picking up in the first half of 2026 and rising to an average of 2%; inflation rises to just above 2.5% in Q3 2026 and then falls to around 2% in 2027.\n\nQ2 Canadian exports look to have fallen by around 25%; Q2 imports likely fell by about 10%.\n\nIn all three scenarios, the nominal neutral interest rate in Canada is estimated to be in the range of 2.25% to 3.25%.\n\nQ2 growth in final domestic demand is estimated to be just above 1%, and Q2 consumption growth is seen at about 1%.\n\nThe Q2 output gap is estimated to have widened to between –1.5% and –0.5% from between –1.0% and 0% in Q1.\n\nMarket reaction\n\nThe Canadian Dollar (CAD) remains on the defensive in a context of persistent USD buying, with USD\/CAD navigating the area of two-month tops beyond the 1.3800 barrier following the BoC’s decision to leave rates unchanged.\n\nCanadian Dollar PRICE Today The table below shows the percentage change of Canadian Dollar (CAD) against listed major currencies today. Canadian Dollar was the strongest against the Australian Dollar. USD EUR GBP JPY CAD AUD NZD CHF USD 0.68% 0.42% 0.46% 0.33% 0.89% 0.66% 0.70% EUR -0.68% -0.23% -0.31% -0.37% 0.17% -0.02% 0.07% GBP -0.42% 0.23% -0.08% -0.08% 0.43% 0.24% 0.32% JPY -0.46% 0.31% 0.08% -0.04% 0.52% 0.30% 0.34% CAD -0.33% 0.37% 0.08% 0.04% 0.56% 0.32% 0.41% AUD -0.89% -0.17% -0.43% -0.52% -0.56% -0.18% -0.11% NZD -0.66% 0.02% -0.24% -0.30% -0.32% 0.18% 0.08% CHF -0.70% -0.07% -0.32% -0.34% -0.41% 0.11% -0.08% The heat map shows percentage changes of major currencies against each other. The base currency is picked from the left column, while the quote currency is picked from the top row. For example, if you pick the Canadian Dollar from the left column and move along the horizontal line to the US Dollar, the percentage change displayed in the box will represent CAD (base)\/USD (quote).\n\nThis section below was published as a preview of the Bank of Canada's (BoC) monetary policy announcements at 09:00 GMT.\n\nFXStreet expects the Bank of Canada to maintain unchanged rates on July 30.\n\nThe Canadian Dollar maintains a positive tone vs. the US Dollar.\n\nThe July meeting could be the fourth consecutive decision with rates at 2.75%.\n\nUS tariffs would remain in the spotlight at Governor Macklem’s press conference.\n\nAs the Bank of Canada (BoC) gets set to issue a new interest rate decision on Wednesday, July 30, there is a growing sense that the cutting cycle might have already ended.\n\nThe BoC decided to keep rates steady in June, citing a Canadian economy that is \"softer but not sharply weaker\" and noting \"firmness in recent inflation data.\" Indeed, the policy rate stands at 2.75%, which remains within the bank’s estimated neutral range for interest rates, set between 2.25% and 3.25%.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's tariff agenda continues to be a significant global influence. Since his January return to the White House, he has dangled a slew of new levies that could ripple through global supply chains, and those threats will likely dominate Governor Tiff Macklem’s post‑meeting press conference.\n\nThe BoC's Q2 Business Outlook Survey (BOS), out on July 21, indicated that Canadian firms are worried about the worst-case tariff situation but are still hesitant to hire and invest. The BOS revealed that companies' short-term inflation predictions have returned to where they were a year ago, and businesses now see a recession scenario as less likely. Earlier this year, businesses were worried that US tariffs would hurt the economy, but so far the effects have mostly been seen in the steel, aluminium, and vehicle industries.\n\nConsumers are feeling the economy’s slowdown in their own pay cheques, the latest Survey of Consumer Expectations shows. With the job market looking softer, more people say they’re uneasy about hanging on to their positions. This anxiety is permeating everyday life as households are reported to be tightening their budgets and altering their shopping habits as the trade war noise intensifies. While they don't anticipate a surge in prices in the near future, many express concern that a new set of tariffs could hinder the central bank's ability to control inflation.\n\nPreviewing the BoC’s interest rate decision, analyst Taylor Schleich at the National Bank of Canada noted, \"There’s growing momentum around the idea that the easing cycle is over. We disagree, and we don’t expect the Governing Council to validate this more hawkish view. Instead, they’re likely to keep guidance unchanged, reiterating that they’re proceeding carefully and monitoring the same four indicators: export demand; tariff impacts on investment, employment, and spending; inflation; and inflation expectations.”\n\nWhen will the BoC release its monetary policy decision, and how could it affect USD\/CAD?\n\nThe Bank of Canada will publish its policy decision on Wednesday at 13:45 GMT alongside its Monetary Policy Report (MPR). After that, Governor Tiff Macklem will attend a press conference at 14:30 GMT.\n\nMost economists expect the Bank of Canada (BoC) to keep its policy rate anchored at 2.75% on July 30, extending the pause begun in May and June. The decision arrives as the Canadian Dollar quietly grinds higher, rebounding from winter lows near 1.4800 vs. its American counterpart to the current vicinity of 1.3700.\n\nPablo Piovano, a Senior Analyst at FXStreet, said that \"USD\/CAD maintains its rebound from the area of yearly in the 1.3550-1.3540 range. While below its key 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) at 1.4038, the bearish scenario is expected to prevail.”\n\n\"USD\/CAD hit a new YTD bottom of 1.3538 on June 16. Once this level is cleared, more losses could go all the way down to the September 2024 floor of 1.3418 (September 25),\" Piovano said.\n\nPiovano adds that \"on the upside, the pair should run into initial resistance at its June ceiling of 1.3797 set on June 23, prior to the May peak of 1.4015 reached on May 12.”\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) has rebounded beyond the 52 level, which means that further upside appears on the cards over a short-term horizon. Piovano ends by saying, \"The Average Directional Index (ADX) below 15 also shows that the trend lacks conviction.\"\n\nInterest rates FAQs What are interest rates? Interest rates are charged by financial institutions on loans to borrowers and are paid as interest to savers and depositors. They are influenced by base lending rates, which are set by central banks in response to changes in the economy. Central banks normally have a mandate to ensure price stability, which in most cases means targeting a core inflation rate of around 2%. If inflation falls below target the central bank may cut base lending rates, with a view to stimulating lending and boosting the economy. If inflation rises substantially above 2% it normally results in the central bank raising base lending rates in an attempt to lower inflation. How do interest rates impact currencies? Higher interest rates generally help strengthen a country’s currency as they make it a more attractive place for global investors to park their money. How do interest rates influence the price of Gold? Higher interest rates overall weigh on the price of Gold because they increase the opportunity cost of holding Gold instead of investing in an interest-bearing asset or placing cash in the bank. If interest rates are high that usually pushes up the price of the US Dollar (USD), and since Gold is priced in Dollars, this has the effect of lowering the price of Gold. What is the Fed Funds rate? The Fed funds rate is the overnight rate at which US banks lend to each other. It is the oft-quoted headline rate set by the Federal Reserve at its FOMC meetings. It is set as a range, for example 4.75%-5.00%, though the upper limit (in that case 5.00%) is the quoted figure. Market expectations for future Fed funds rate are tracked by the CME FedWatch tool, which shapes how many financial markets behave in anticipation of future Federal Reserve monetary policy decisions.",

        "text":"The Federal Reserve is expected to leave the policy rate unchanged for the fifth consecutive meeting.\n\nThe statement language and comments from Fed Chair Powell could offer key clues about the policy outlook.\n\nThe US Dollar could weaken in case investors are convinced of a rate cut in September.\n\nThe United States (US) Federal Reserve (Fed) will announce its interest rate decision and publish the policy statement following the July policy meeting on Wednesday.\n\nMarket participants widely anticipate the US central bank will leave policy settings unchanged for the fifth consecutive meeting after cutting the interest rate by 25 basis points (bps) to the 4.25%-4.50% range last December.\n\nThe CME FedWatch Tool shows that investors virtually see no chance of a rate cut in July, while pricing in about a 64% probability of a 25 bps reduction in September. This market positioning suggests that the US Dollar faces a two-way risk heading into the event.\n\nThe revised Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), published in June, showed that policymakers’ projections implied 50 bps of rate cuts in 2025, followed by 25 bps reduction in both 2026 and 2027. Seven of 19 Fed officials pencilled in no cuts in 2025, two of them saw one cut, while eight of them projected two and two of them forecast three cuts this year.\n\nFollowing the June meeting, Fed Governor Christopher Waller voiced his support for a July rate cut in his public appearances, arguing that they should not wait until the labor market is in trouble before easing the policy. Similarly, Fed Governor Michelle Bowman said that she is open to cutting rates as soon as July since inflation pressures remain contained. Meanwhile, United States (US) President Donald Trump extended his attempts to pressure the US central bank into cutting interest rates in July. While addressing reporters alongside British Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Monday, Trump reiterated that the US economy could be doing better if the Fed were to cut rates.\n\nPreviewing the Fed meeting, “the FOMC is again widely expected to keep its policy stance unchanged next week, with the Committee maintaining rates at 4.25%-4.50%,” noted analysts at TD Securities. “We expect Powell to repeat his patient, data-dependent policy stance while maintaining flexibility around the Committee's next move in September. We believe two dissents, from Governors Bowman and Waller, are likely at this meeting.”\n\nWhen will the Fed announce its interest rate decision and how could it affect EUR\/USD?\n\nThe Fed is scheduled to announce its interest rate decision and publish the monetary policy statement on Wednesday at 18:00 GMT. This will be followed by Fed Chair Jerome Powell's press conference starting at 18:30 GMT.\n\nIn case Powell leaves the door open for a rate cut in September, citing alleviated uncertainty after the US reached trade deals with some major partners, such as the European Union and Japan, the USD could come under renewed selling pressure with the immediate reaction.\n\nConversely, the USD could gather strength against its rivals if Powell repeats the need for a patient approach to policy-easing, highlighting sticky June inflation readings and relatively healthy labor market conditions. In this scenario, investors could refrain from pricing in a rate cut in September and wait for new inflation and employment data.\n\nEren Sengezer, European Session Lead Analyst at FXStreet, provides a short-term technical outlook for EUR\/USD:\n\n“The near-term technical outlook points to a buildup of bearish momentum. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator on the daily chart stays below 50 and EUR\/USD trades below the 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) for the first time since late February.”\n\n“On the downside, 1.1440 (Fibonacci 23.6% retracement level of the February-July uptrend) aligns as the next support level ahead of 1.1340 (100-day SMA) and 1.1200 (Fibonacci 38.2% retracement). Looking north, resistance levels could be spotted at 1.1700 (20-day SMA), 1.1830 (end-point of the uptrend) and 1.1900 (static level, round level).”",

        "text":"Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) play a central role in the retirement planning strategy of American households. These accounts offer significant tax advantages for those seeking to save for retirement, particularly as a complement to or in the absence of an occupational retirement savings plan such as a 401(k).\n\nAmong the various types of IRAs available, two options are sometimes confused: Traditional IRAs and Spousal IRAs. Yet their functions, eligibility criteria and benefits are quite distinct.\n\nTraditional IRA: The classic formula\n\nThe Traditional IRA is an individual retirement savings account that allows contributions to be made with pre-tax income, thereby reducing taxable income for the current year.\n\nThe gains generated (interest, dividends, capital gains) from the investments are not taxed until withdrawn. It’s a tax-deferred growth mechanism that encourages long-term capital accumulation.\n\nHowever, withdrawals made after age 59 and a half are taxed as ordinary income. Before that age, early withdrawals are penalized, apart from certain exceptions.\n\nFrom age 73, Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs) must be made, imposing an annual minimum withdrawal schedule.\n\nThe Traditional IRA is open to anyone with taxable income, even if they are also covered by a 401(k) plan or Social Security benefits. However, deductibility of contributions depends on household income.\n\nThe Spousal IRA: A valuable exception for married couples\n\nThe Spousal IRA is a special provision that enables a spouse with no income, or very low income, to benefit from an Individual Retirement Account (IRA) thanks to his or her partner's income.\n\nThis is a particularly useful solution in families where one of the spouses stays at home, raises the children or is temporarily out of the job market.\n\nThe principle is simple: the working spouse can finance an IRA on behalf of the non-working spouse, as long as the couple declares their income jointly and the household income covers the total amount of the contributions.\n\nBut there is something important to note: Although funded by the active spouse, the account belongs entirely to the beneficiary spouse. This is a real recognition of his or her long-term financial autonomy, even without direct professional activity.\n\nIn short, a Spousal IRA is a means of accessing a Traditional IRA (or Roth IRA ) for people who, in theory, would not be entitled to one. It is not, therefore, a separate type of IRA, but a special eligibility scheme.\n\nTax and contribution advantages of Spousal IRAs\n\nThe tax advantages of Spousal IRAs are identical to those of conventional IRAs. The inactive spouse can choose between a Traditional IRA (deductible contributions, taxable withdrawals) or a Roth IRA (non-deductible contributions, tax-free withdrawals), depending on the household income level.\n\nIn 2025, the contribution limit is $7,000 per person, or $8,000 if one or both spouses are age 50 or over, thanks to the catch-up contribution.\n\nThis means that a couple can contribute up to $14,000 or $16,000 a year to two separate IRAs, provided their overall taxable income allows it.\n\nThis ability to double retirement savings via two separate accounts represents a powerful lever for retirement planning, especially when you consider the long-term benefits of compounding .\n\nWhy the Spousal IRA is essential for retirement planning\n\nThe Spousal IRA is much more than a tax solution, it's a tool for financial inclusion. Too often, spouses without a regular income neglect their long-term financial security.\n\nYet Social Security benefits or a spouse's income are not always enough to guarantee a secure retirement, especially in the event of death, divorce or a change in professional situation.\n\nOpening a Spousal IRA means actively preparing for your retirement, even without personal income. It also means offering your family greater financial stability in the future by better distributing sources of income at retirement age.\n\nWhich retirement strategy is right for your household?\n\nThe choice between a Traditional IRA and a Spousal IRA doesn't conflict. The Spousal IRA is a gateway to a Traditional IRA (or Roth IRA) when personal income is lacking or insufficient. For married couples with unequal incomes, it is a formidable planning tool.\n\nIn a global retirement planning logic, it is often wise to maximize both accounts. This makes it possible to double retirement savings while taking advantage of immediate (Traditional IRA) or deferred (Roth IRA) tax benefits, depending on household income and objectives.\n\nBy intelligently integrating the Spousal IRA into your retirement strategy, you can strengthen the security of each spouse and prepare for the future on a more balanced basis.",

The Minnesota-based company reported adjusted earnings per share of $4.08, which was more than 8% off the $4.45 consensus target.\n\nAdditionally, the health insurer lowered its full-year 2025 guidance on revenue. UNH stock sank below $267 toward the vicinity of its five-year lows witnessed on May 15.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), which includes UNH as a top holding, shed 0.5%, while the NASDAQ Composite lost 0.4% and the S&P 500 dropped 0.3%. The negativity follows a poor showing from the JOLTS Job Openings report that arrived at 7.437 million open positions in June, which was below the 7.55 million consensus and the 7.771 revised figure from May.\n\nMeanwhile, the Conference Board's US Consumer Confidence Index rose to 97.2 in July from 95.2 in June. However, the US stock market focused on a slew of negative earnings releases. Besides UnitedHealth, UPS (UPS), Merck (MRK), PayPal (PYPL) and Boeing (BA) all sold off substantially on poor showings.\n\nUnitedHealth Group earnings review\n\nRevenue of $111.62 billion was a bright spot in UnitedHealth's second-quarter release. The figure rose 13% YoY and beat consensus by $30 million.\n\nThe downside was once again the sharply rising medical costs that health insurers across the country are facing. The company reported a consolidated medical care ratio of 89.4%, which was 430 basis points higher than a year earlier and wiped out much of its profits.\n\nManagement blamed the government's reduction in Medicare funding, as well as higher medical intensity trends and unit costs. UnitedHealth's former CEO Andrew Witty left in May after first-quarter results showed a similar stark reversal in fortunes.\n\nFor the full-year 2025 outlook, management gave a midpoint of $446.75 billion, which compares negatively to the past guidance for $449 billion. Still, the insurer remains on a customer growth trajectory for both Optum and UnitedHealthcare segments.\n\nManagement also lowered the 2025 guidance for adjusted EPS to $16.00 from $20.90. Looking ahead, some investors are worried about the US government reducing funding to the Medicare Part D program that funds pharmaceuticals for seniors. The Trump administration is set to reduce funding by 40% in 2026, which will sharply increase costs for the retired population by way of spiking premiums.\n\nUnitedHealth Group stock forecast\n\nUNH stock is now well off its all-time high from November 2024 above $630, down 57% in just nine months. Trending below the 200-day, 100-day and 50-day Exponential Moving Averages, UNH is still trading above the May 15 low of $248.88.\n\nLong-term holders will add to positions here, knowing that the insurance industry is generally safe and will revert higher as cyclical issues fade. But many will also stay on the sidelines as the US Justice Department continues its investigation of Medicare billing practices.\n\nTrading near the oversold region on Tuesday with a Relative Strength Index (RSI) reading of 31, most institutional holders won't repurchase UNH until a confirmed close above the $342 level or a closing of the May 12 gap at $376.84.\n\nTraders will expect some time to pass before UNH makes its way back to those levels. For right now, the only bull targets in sight are the 50-day and 100-day SMA in the $290s.\n\nUNH daily stock chart\n\n\n\n",
