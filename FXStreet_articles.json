        "text":"The number of job openings on the last business day of June stood at 7.43 million, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reported in the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) on Tuesday. This reading followed the 7.71 million openings (revised from 7.76 million) recorded in May and came in below the market expectation of 7.55 million.\n\n\"Over the month, both hires and total separations were little changed at 5.2 million and 5.1 million, respectively,\" the press release read. \"Within separations, quits (3.1 million) were little changed while layoffs and discharges (1.6 million) were unchanged.\"\n\nMarket reaction to JOLTS Job Openings data\n\nThe US Dollar (USD) Index preserves its bullish momentum and was last seen rising 0.35% on the day at 99.00.\n\nUS Dollar PRICE This week The table below shows the percentage change of US Dollar (USD) against listed major currencies this week. US Dollar was the strongest against the Euro.

The base currency is picked from the left column, while the quote currency is picked from the top row. For example, if you pick the US Dollar from the left column and move along the horizontal line to the Japanese Yen, the percentage change displayed in the box will represent USD (base)\/JPY (quote).\n\n\n\n\n\nThis section below was published as a preview of the US JOLTS Job Openings data at 09:00 GMT.\n\nThe US JOLTS data will be watched closely ahead of the release of the July Nonfarm Payrolls report on Friday.\n\nJob Openings are forecast to edge lower to 7.55 million in June.\n\nThe state of the labor market is a key factor for Fed officials when setting interest rates.\n\nThe Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) will be released on Tuesday by the United States (US) Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The publication will provide data about the change in the number of Job Openings in June, alongside the number of layoffs and quits.\n\nJOLTS data is scrutinized by market participants and Federal Reserve (Fed) policymakers because it can provide valuable insights into the supply-demand dynamics in the labor market, a key factor impacting salaries and inflation. Job Openings have been declining steadily since reaching 12 million in March 2022, indicating a steady cooldown in labor market conditions. In January of this year, the number of Job Openings came in above 7.7 million before declining to 7.2 million by March. Since then, JOLTS Job Openings rose for two consecutive months, reaching 7.76 million in May.\n\nWhat to expect in the next JOLTS report?\n\nMarkets expect Job Openings for June to decline to 7.55 million. Although concerns over an economic downturn eased after the United States (US) reached trade agreements with Japan and the European Union (EU), there is still uncertainty surrounding the inflation outlook. Hence, Federal Reserve (Fed) policymakers could refrain from easing monetary policy unless labor market conditions worsen in a noticeable way.\n\nThe CME FedWatch Tool shows that markets virtually see no chance of a rate cut at the upcoming July 29-30 Fed policy meeting. Nevertheless, a significant negative surprise in the JOLTS Job Openings data, with a reading below 7 million, could feed into expectations for a 25-basis-point rate cut in September, which currently has a probability of about 60%. In this scenario, the US Dollar (USD) could come under pressure with the immediate reaction.\n\nOn the other hand, a reading near the market consensus, or better, could help the USD to hold its ground. Regardless, investors could opt to stay on the sidelines ahead of the Fed policy announcements on Wednesday, not allowing the data to have a long-lasting impact on the USD’s valuation.\n\nWhen will the JOLTS report be released and how could it affect EUR\/USD?\n\nJob Openings will be published on Tuesday at 14:00 GMT. Eren Sengezer, European Session Lead Analyst at FXStreet, shares his technical outlook for EUR\/USD:\n\n“The near-term technical outlook points to a buildup of bearish momentum in EUR\/USD. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator on the daily chart declined below 50 and the pair broke below the 20-day Simple Moving Average (SMA), currently located at 1.1700.”\n\n“On the downside, the 50-day SMA aligns as the immediate support level at 1.1560 before 1.1450 (Fibonacci 23.6% retracement of the February-July uptrend) and 1.1335 (100-day SMA). Looking north, resistance levels could be spotted at 1.1700 (20-day SMA), 1.780 (static level) and 1.1830 (end-point of the uptrend).”",

        "text":"At a time when preparing for retirement increasingly relies on individual savings, Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) are establishing themselves as essential pillars of retirement planning in the United States.\n\nBut how much do you really need to have set aside by age 30, 40 or 60? A recent study by Fidelity , based on an analysis of 16.8 million IRA accounts, sheds valuable light on average balances by age. An opportunity to compare your situation and, above all, to draw concrete conclusions.\n\nStriking differences between generations\n\nData for the fourth quarter of 2024 reveal a logical but impressive progression of IRA balances with age. Here are the average balances observed:\n\nGeneration Z (13-28 years): $6,672\n\n$6,672 Millennials (29-44 years): $25,109\n\n$25,109 Generation X (45-60 years): $103,952\n\n$103,952 Baby Boomers (61-79): $257,002\n\nAs the years go by, the cumulative effect of regular contributions, stock market performance and compounding inflates the amounts. This growth is a powerful reminder of the benefits of starting an IRA early , even with small amounts.\n\nWhat you should have saved for retirement\n\nIn addition to observed averages, Fidelity offers benchmarks to let you know if you're on the right track. For example:\n\nAge Average IRA balance Recommended savings 20s $8,023\n\n30s $21,304 1x annual salary 40s $57,326 3x annual salary 50s $124,606 6x annual salary 60s $233,781 8x to 10x annual salary 70+ $297,988\n\n\n\nThese benchmarks allow you to set realistic goals while taking into account your own income.\n\nIf you earn $75,000 a year, aiming for $225,000 in savings by age 40 is a good target, according to Fidelity.\n\nSource: Fidelity\n\nThe central role of IRAs in retirement planning\n\nIn a landscape where traditional pensions are gradually disappearing and Social Security is no longer enough to guarantee a comfortable standard of living, IRAs have become indispensable.\n\nThey often complement a 401(k), or even replace it in the absence of a company plan.\n\nThe two main variants, the Traditional IRA and the Roth IRA , offer distinct tax advantages.\n\nThe former allows contributions to be deducted from taxable income (but withdrawals will be taxed later), while the latter taxes contributions upstream but exempts withdrawals.\n\nIn both cases, gains benefit from a snowball effect thanks to the absence of annual taxation.\n\nThe snowball effect of time and discipline\n\nWhat long-term trends demonstrate is that IRA accounts benefit fully from the combination of regularity and patience.\n\nWith consistent contributions and a growth-oriented investment strategy, even modest amounts at the outset can be transformed, over decades, into substantial capital for retirement.\n\nThe progressive growth of IRA balances illustrates the power of compounding. The earlier you start, the more your savings benefit from a cumulative effect.\n\nThis doesn't mean that it's too late to start saving at an older age, but it does underline that acting early offers an advantage that's hard to make up for.\n\nWhen it comes to retirement planning, time remains a precious ally, provided you use it rigorously.\n\nConcrete retirement strategies for every age\n\nIn your twenties: Start contributing, even small amounts. The important thing is to get into the habit.\n\nStart contributing, even small amounts. The important thing is to get into the habit. In your thirties: Try to reach 1x your annual salary and give preference to dynamic investments.\n\nTry to reach 1x your annual salary and give preference to dynamic investments. In your forties: Go up to 3x your salary and adjust if you're behind.\n\nGo up to 3x your salary and adjust if you're behind. In your fifties: Use catch-up contributions authorized from age 50 ($8,000 in 2025).\n\nUse catch-up contributions authorized from age 50 ($8,000 in 2025). From age 60: Prepare for the transition to Required Minimum Distributions (RMD), mandatory from age 73.\n\nIRA and automation: The key to regularity\n\nOne of the best ways to save regularly is to automate your IRA contributions.\n\nBy matching payments to the frequency of salaries (on the 15th and 30th of the month, for example), savers ensure that they remain disciplined, without having to think about it every month.\n\nWhat's more, it's advisable to gradually increase the amounts, for example, by allocating an extra 1% each year when a salary increase occurs.\n\nA powerful tool, provided it's put to good use\n\nIndividual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) offer flexibility, tax advantages and growth potential, making them an essential tool in retirement planning.\n\nWhether you're a young worker or close to retirement, the important thing is to know where you stand, to compare without feeling guilty, and to adjust your strategy.\n\nFinally, remember that Social Security alone will probably not be enough to cover the needs of a comfortable retirement. The IRA, properly used, can fill the gap, provided you act early... and regularly.",

        "text":"Nike stock gains 4% on JPMorgan upgrade.\n\nAnalyst Matthew Boss gives NKE shares a $93 price target.\n\nJPMorgan cites return to form as inventory issues worked through.\n\nTrump trade agreement with EU a positive sign for equities.\n\nNike (NKE) stock is off to the races on Monday as the athletic brand surges over 4% in response to a bullish turn from JPMorgan. The venerated investment bank came out with a $93 price target on the down-on-its-luck footwear company.\n\nNike stock rose within spitting distance of the $80 psychological level it hasn't touched since March 10 of this year.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), which holds Nike as a constituent, is slightly ahead with Nike's urging despite measured pullbacks from Travelers (TRV), Cisco (CSCO) and Verizon (VZ). The market overall is cautiously optimistic at the start of the week after President Trump inked a 15% tariff deal with the European Union (EU) over the weekend. Trump also said on Monday that other countries who had not yet signed trade deals would get 15% to 20% tariff rates come August 1, another sign that the worst possibilities might be over.\n\nTraders are looking ahead to the June JOLTS Job Openings report on Tuesday, Wednesday's Federal Reserve (Fed) interest rate decision and press conference, and the July Nonfarm Payrolls report on Friday.\n\nNike stock news\n\nAfter a long bout of switching management and working through overhang from inventory liquidation issues, JPMorgan analyst Matthew Boss expects revenues to rise over the next 18 months as Nike returns to a better performance interval.\n\n\"Further, we see opportunity for NKE to recapture over 500bps of operating margin erosion on improved full-price selling & reception to new product innovation, and as NKE begins to leverage on SG&A expenses with an inflection to topline growth,\" Boss wrote in a client memo, attaching a $93 price target to NKE shares.\n\nThe price target does seem high as it comes from offering Nike stock a 37x multiple to estimated fiscal 2027 earnings per share (EPS) of $2.49.\n\nAfter the Trump administration this summer finalized a trade agreement with Vietnam, where Nike produces the majority of its products, Nike management seems less worried about tariffs, announcing that it will mitigate the higher costs via arrangements with suppliers, price increases, and corporate downsizing.\n\nNike stock forecast\n\nNike shares are approaching the $80 price level, but bulls will look for a retest of the $82.44 resistance last tested it on February 26. Meanwhile, the 200-day is gliding along near $71.00, and the stock appears to be overbought on the Relative Strength Index (RSI) with a reading of 71.\n\n\n\n\n\nNKE daily stock chart\n\nThe long-term downward trending price channel on the weekly chart below tells us that the bearish structure is now behind us. Bulls will hope that an upward sloping price channel will be formed in its space, but the first necessary evidence will be a confirmed close above the $82.44 level, marking a new higher high for the first time in four years.",
