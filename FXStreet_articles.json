        "text":"Whether it's long-distance travel, a small garden to tend each morning or quality time spent with loved ones, the retirement you envision deserves a clear financial strategy.\n\nAt the heart of that strategy is often a valuable tool: the Individual Retirement Account (IRA). But how can you be sure that your IRA is leading you to the retirement of your dreams? Here's how to align your retirement accounts with your life goals.\n\nDreaming, yes. But put a figure on it\n\nRetirement planning doesn't start with an Excel spreadsheet. It starts with a vision. Would you like to live by a lake? Travel across America in an RV? Launch a personal project or simply live serenely?\n\nThis vision, however personal, forms the basis of your retirement goals. It gives meaning to your savings strategy and justifies your long-term efforts.\n\nBut dreaming is not enough. You need to translate these aspirations into concrete figures. How much do your plans cost? What will your annual expenses be in retirement? Where will you live? At what age do you want to stop working? Based on these elements, you can determine the size of the retirement capital you'll need.\n\nIRAs: Your ally in achieving your goals\n\nIndividual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) are powerful tools for building your retirement. Unlike a simple savings account, an IRA offers significant tax advantages, which vary according to the type chosen ( Traditional or Roth IRA ).\n\nThe Traditional account allows you to deduct your contributions from your taxable income, while the Roth IRA offers tax-free withdrawals provided you meet certain conditions.\n\nIn both cases, the IRA is a structured instrument for growing your savings over time. Thanks to the cumulative effect of compound interest and the potential growth of financial markets, it can help you reach your retirement goals more quickly than other forms of savings.\n\nA strategy aligned with your retirement goals\n\nIt's not enough to have an IRA, it has to be aligned with your true retirement goals.\n\nAn asset allocation adapted to your time horizon\n\nIf you're still a long way from retirement, you can afford a growth strategy, with greater exposure to Equities .\n\nAs you approach retirement, a transition to more stable investments (Bonds, cash) can secure your assets.\n\nRegular, adjusted contributions\n\nSaving automatically, every month or every paycheck, is one of the best ways to reach your goals.\n\nRemember to take advantage of annual contribution limits and, if you're over 50, catch-up contributions authorized by the IRS.\n\nIntegration into your overall retirement plan\n\nIRAs don't work in a vacuum. They often complement other sources such as a 401(k), a company retirement plan or Social Security benefits.\n\nAn effective strategy takes all these elements into account.\n\nThe role of Social Security in the equation\n\nSocial Security benefits, often seen as a minimum guarantee, need to be integrated into your retirement plan.\n\nDelaying their activation (until age 70) can significantly increase your monthly income.\n\nA good balance between IRA withdrawals and Social Security benefits can optimize your tax situation while securing your income.\n\nBeware of taxes in retirement\n\nWithdrawals from a Traditional IRA are taxable. This means that your withdrawal strategy must be carefully thought out: At what age should you withdraw? At what pace? Should you convert to a Roth IRA before retirement?\n\nA well-designed plan will maximize your net income while limiting the tax impact.\n\nReview and adjust regularly\n\nYour retirement goals may evolve as a result of changes in your life, health or even priorities. So it's essential to review your plan at least once a year.\n\nA financial advisor can help you adjust your allowances, contributions and withdrawal schedule to stay in line with your retirement planning.\n\nBuilding the retirement you deserve\n\nAligning your IRA with your retirement goals is more than just saving, it's planning a life project.\n\nIt's about building a future where your desires can become reality, thanks to a well-thought-out financial strategy, adapted tools like the Individual Retirement Account (IRA), and a clear vision of what you expect from this new stage.",

        "text":"Bitcoin price has been consolidating within the $116,000-$120,000 range for 16 days.\n\nWhale wallets continue their buying spree and OTC balance reaches record lows.\n\nJPMorgan and Coinbase sign a deal to link customers’ bank accounts to their crypto wallets directly.\n\nThe White House released its crypto report on Wednesday, pushing for regulatory clarity.\n\nBitcoin (BTC) price is trading above $118,500 at the time of writing on Thursday, continuing a consolidation phase that has been underway for the past 16 days. Despite the lack of a clear price direction, on-chain data shows some signs of optimism for the largest cryptocurrency as large-wallet holders' accumulation increases and Over-The-Counter (OTC) balance has reached record lows.\n\nMarket participants are also digesting two major positive developments for the digital asset space — the crypto policy report from the White House and a partnership between JPMorgan and Coinbase.\n\nWhite House releases its first virtual asset policy\n\nThe White House released its first virtual asset policy on Wednesday, as required by US President Donald Trump’s Executive Order (EO) 14178. The report, spanning over 160 pages, contains dozens of recommendations related to crypto policy and pushes for regulatory clarity in the US.\n\n“By implementing these recommendations, policymakers can ensure that the United States leads the blockchain revolution and ushers in the Golden Age of Crypto,” the White House said in a fact sheet on the report from the Working Group on Digital Asset Markets.\n\nDavid Sacks, Special Advisor for AI and Crypto, led the Working Group on Digital Asset Markets, alongside other delegates, including Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Paul Atkins.\n\nThe report had a muted impact on Bitcoin's price, as BTC stabilized at around $111,700 on that day. Market participants likely ignored the text as the subject of the Bitcoin Strategic Reserve, which is key, was not clearly addressed.\n\nHowever, key areas of interest include recommendations for the US SEC to establish clear guidelines for the development of tokenized stocks and treasuries. It also presses regulators to clarify “permissible bank activities” regarding stablecoins and the use of blockchains, promote transparency on how institutions can obtain bank charters, and ensure that bank capital rules better reflect the risks particular to digital assets.\n\nJPMorgan and Coinbase join hands to link bank accounts to crypto wallets\n\nBloomberg reported on Thursday that US bank JPMorgan Chase & Co. and American cryptocurrency exchange, Coinbase Global Inc., had signed an agreement to link customers’ bank accounts to their cryptocurrency wallets directly.\n\n“The connections between Chase bank accounts and Coinbase crypto wallets are expected to go live next year,” reported Bloomberg.\n\nThe deal marks a shift away from reliance on data aggregators such as Plaid Inc., MX Technologies Inc., or Akoya, which have traditionally served as behind-the-scenes connectors between the companies and banks.\n\nThe partnership indicates a bullish long-term impact on the cryptocurrency market, including Bitcoin, as it enhances wider adoption, growing cooperation between traditional banks and crypto platforms.\n\nFed keeps interest rates unchanged\n\nThe US Federal Reserve (Fed) kept the interest rate unchanged at 4.25% to 4.50% range for the fifth consecutive time, despite intense pressure from US President Donald Trump and his allies to lower borrowing costs.\n\nBitcoin price was muted on this news and stabilized around $117,000 on Wednesday, as the market had broadly expected the Fed to keep interest rates unchanged.\n\nThe decision, however, met opposition from Fed Governors Michelle Bowman and Christopher Waller. This was the first time since 1993 that two governors had dissented on a rate decision.\n\nHaresh Menghani, an analyst at FXStreet, reported that in the accompanying monetary policy statement, the committee had a more optimistic view and noted that the economy continued to expand at a solid pace.\n\nAdding to this, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said during the post-meeting press conference that the central bank had made no decisions about whether to cut rates in September, highlighting Powell’s hawkish stance, which does not bode well with riskier assets like Bitcoin prices.\n\nTraders now look to the Fed's preferred inflation gauge – the core PCE Price Index – for a fresh impetus for Bitcoin.\n\nSigns of optimism\n\nDespite the ongoing 16 days of consolidation and US interest rates remaining unchanged, on-chain data shows some signs of optimism for BTC.\n\nSantiment chart below shows that wallets with 10 to 10,000 BTC holdings have constantly accumulated 218,570 BTC more since late March. These key stakeholders collectively hold 68.44% of all of Bitcoin's supply, adding 0.9% of all coins to their wallets during this time frame.\n\nLooking down on the Over-The-Counter (OTC) wallet balance provides a clearer picture for large accumulation. CryptoQuant data indicates that the OTC balance for BTC has been steadily decreasing, reaching its lowest level ever, which suggests that large investors (market whales) or institutions are not selling BTC at OTC.\n\nBitcoin Total OTC Desk Balance chart. Source: CryptoQuant\n\nBitcoin Price Forecast: BTC trades sideways\n\nBitcoin price has been trading broadly sideways, between $116,000 and $120,000, for the past 16 days after reaching a new all-time high (ATH) of $123,218 on July 14.\n\nThe daily chart below shows that a similar range-bound scenario had unfolded when BTC reached its ATH of $111,980 back on May 22, when it consolidated for 47 days, before the breakout.\n\nIf BTC closes above the upper boundary of the consolidation range at $120,000 on a daily basis, it could extend the recovery toward the fresh all-time high at $123,218.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart reads 59 and points upward, indicating that bullish momentum is gaining traction.\n\nBTC\/USDT daily chart\n\nHowever, if BTC breaks below the lower consolidation boundary at $116,000 on a daily basis, it could extend the decline to retest the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $112,952.",

        "text":"15-Year Trading Expert Moderates \"Launch, Survive, Scale\" Panel, Revealing How to Build a Fintech That Actually Works\"\n\nVitalii Bulynin, Co-Founder of innovative CFD broker Versus Trade, took the stage at IFX Expo International in Limassol, Cyprus as moderator of the high-impact panel \"Launch, Survive,Scale: Building a Fintech That Actually Works,\" sharing hard-won insights from his journey from managing from being a student and managing million dollar portfolio afterclass to building a next-generation trading broker.\n\nFrom Trading Floor to Conference Stage\n\nBulynin’s path to industry thought leadership began in 2005 with a MetaTrader 3 account and a focus on the notoriously volatile GBP\/JPY pair. Through self-taught MQL programming and relentless market analysis, he evolved from a retail trader to an institutional-level portfolio manager, eventually overseeing multi-million dollar trading operations. His career trajectory saw him rise from a junior dealer to executive director, reflecting a rare combination of trading expertise and strategic leadership.\n\nIn 2018, he spearheaded the development of a full-scale margin trading infrastructure for crypto exchange Cryptology — at a time when leveraged digital asset trading was still in its infancy. That same year marked a shift in his professional focus toward senior leadership, with Bulynin primarily serving as an Executive Director across regulated brokerage firms.\n\nHaving worked within the Cyprus regulatory environment since 2014, he has helped launch multiple brokers from the ground — navigating compliance, licensing, and product development. His expertise spans both CFD and crypto markets, having held senior roles including Head of Trading at major brokers. He has also served as a non-executive director on the boards of several regulated entities, contributing to strategic oversight and governance.\n\n\"The transition from trader to fintech founder isn't just about understanding markets – it's about understanding the fundamental flaws in how the industry serves traders,\" Bulynin explained during his moderation. \"When you've personally experienced the frustrations of slow execution, hidden fees, and poor customer service, you build solutions differently.\"\n\nReal-World Fintech Building Insights\n\nDuring the panel discussion, Bulynin shared three critical insights that emerged from Versus Trade's development:\n\n1. Technical Excellence Isn't Optional \"We've seen too many fintech startups fail because they prioritized marketing over infrastructure. Versus Trade, is investing in safety and stability from day one – because traders remember the one time your platform failed more than a hundred times it worked perfectly.\"\n\n2. Industry Experience Accelerates Everything \"I have shared all my experience of 20 years in trading to the Versus Trade’s team with a single idea in my mind - to avoid the common mistakes that sink new brokers. We knew where the real pain points were – not just what traders say they want, but what they actually need.\"\n\n3. Partnerships Define Success \"Building a fintech isn't just about your technology – it's about your ecosystem. For example Versus Trade chose premium partners like Sumsub for KYC because client trust isn't negotiable, even when cheaper alternatives exist.\"\n\nVersus Trade's Innovation and Future Development\n\nVersus Trade brought its distinctive approach to CFD trading through innovative asset-versus-asset instruments. The platform's unique \"Versus Pairs\" allow traders to position themselves in comparative market narratives - such as digital assets against traditional investments (Bitcoin vs Gold), or regional market dynamics like Eastern versus Western economies (Amazon vs Alibaba).\n\nThe company has ambitious development plans ahead, including significant product enhancements, expanded partnership opportunities, and the introduction of additional versus pairs across various asset classes. These initiatives aim to strengthen the broker's core offering while providing traders with more diverse opportunities to engage with cross-market themes and relative performance dynamics.\n\nIFX Expo International Success and Industry Response\n\nThe IFX Expo International in Limassol, Cyprus, featured numerous engaging discussions across the fintech landscape. Bulynin's panel on fintech development drew a positive audience response, with participants appreciating the practical insights shared during the session. The conference provided valuable networking opportunities and showcased various innovations shaping the trading industry's future.\n\nThe discussion highlighted how successful fintech platforms require understanding both market mechanics and trader needs. Bulynin emphasized the importance of building solutions that address real trading challenges rather than following theoretical approaches that may not work in practice.\n\nMedia Contact: [email protected]\n\nSpeaking Opportunities: For interviews with Vitalii Bulynin about fintech development, trading industry trends, or Versus Trade's innovations, contact: [email protected]",

        "text":"EUR\/USD regained some composure and rebounded modestly.\n\nThe US Dollar extended its upside momentum to new two-month highs.\n\nInvestors’ attention now shifts to the release of the US Nonfarm Payrolls.\n\nThe Euro managed to trigger a humble rebound on Thursday, partially recouping ground lost vs. the US Dollar (USD) in the past few sessions.\n\nThat said, EUR\/USD briefly tested the 1.1400 neighbourhood, just to regain traction afterwards and attempt a move to the 1.1460 zone, always against the backdrop of the still unabated march north in the Greenback.\n\nUS Dollar buoyed by tariffs and growth\n\nThe newly unveiled US–EU trade framework gave the US Dollar a fresh jolt. The agreement imposes a 15% tariff on most EU exports to the US—higher than the 10% rate in place since April, but far less severe than the 30% initially threatened. Sensitive sectors such as aerospace, semiconductors, chemicals, and selected agricultural products were spared, while steel and aluminium remain subject to 50% levies.\n\nIn return, the EU committed to purchasing $750 billion of US energy, ramping up defence procurement from American firms, and pledging over $600 billion in direct investment in the US economy.\n\nReinforcing USD optimism, ADP payrolls surprised the upside with a 104K gain, while flash GDP pointed to 3.0% annualised growth in Q2—outpacing forecasts and reinforcing the narrative of US economic resilience. In the meantime, the latest US data showed a firm labour market, while inflation tracked by the PCE ticked higher in June.\n\nBut Europe pushes back\n\nNot everyone on the Continent is cheering the latest trade accord: German Chancellor Friedrich Merz warned the tariff hike would weigh on already fragile industrial output, while French President Emmanuel Macron slammed the pact as “a dark day” for Europe—underscoring growing unease about the long-term costs of the deal.\n\nCentral banks hold the line\n\nBoth the Fed and ECB kept rates steady this week.\n\nAt the Fed, the hawkish tone from Chair Jerome Powell collided with dissents from Governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, all adding to the steady uncertainty over the future path of US rates. In addition, Powell gave little away, signalling no rush to ease amid persistent inflation risks.\n\nAcross the Atlantic, ECB President Christine Lagarde struck a more optimistic tone, describing eurozone growth as “solid, if not a little bit better.” Markets have since rolled back expectations for a rate cut this autumn, pushing bets out to spring 2026.\n\nSpeculative positions shift\n\nCFTC data through July 22 showed a notable unwind in speculative EUR positions. Speculative net longs were trimmed to around 125.5K contracts—the lowest in two weeks—while institutional net shorts fell to roughly 177.7K. Furthermore, open interest rose for a fifth straight week, nearing 843.5K contracts, pointing to sustained market engagement.\n\nCharts to watch\n\nFor bulls to regain control, EUR\/USD would need to retake the 2025 high of 1.1830 (July 1) and then challenge the September 2021 peak at 1.1909, with the psychological 1.2000 mark looming beyond.\n\nOn the other hand, initial support sits at the July low of 1.1401 (July 31), then the provisional 100-day SMA at 1.1355, and the weekly base of 1.1210 (May 29).\n\nThe momentum indicators are displaying conflicting signals: the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has risen above 34, indicating potential further decline, while an Average Directional Index (ADX) reading close to 24 indicates the current trend is gaining momentum.\n\nEURUSD daily chart\n\nOutlook: more drift than direction\n\nUnless the Fed signals a clear dovish pivot or trade tensions de-escalate meaningfully, EUR\/USD is expected to remain at the mercy of US Dollar dynamic. For now, the path of least resistance continues to favour the Greenback.\n\nEuro FAQs What is the Euro? The Euro is the currency for the 19 European Union countries that belong to the Eurozone. It is the second most heavily traded currency in the world behind the US Dollar. In 2022, it accounted for 31% of all foreign exchange transactions, with an average daily turnover of over $2.2 trillion a day. EUR\/USD is the most heavily traded currency pair in the world, accounting for an estimated 30% off all transactions, followed by EUR\/JPY (4%), EUR\/GBP (3%) and EUR\/AUD (2%). What is the ECB and how does it impact the Euro? The European Central Bank (ECB) in Frankfurt, Germany, is the reserve bank for the Eurozone. The ECB sets interest rates and manages monetary policy. The ECB’s primary mandate is to maintain price stability, which means either controlling inflation or stimulating growth. Its primary tool is the raising or lowering of interest rates. Relatively high interest rates – or the expectation of higher rates – will usually benefit the Euro and vice versa. The ECB Governing Council makes monetary policy decisions at meetings held eight times a year. Decisions are made by heads of the Eurozone national banks and six permanent members, including the President of the ECB, Christine Lagarde. How does inflation data impact the value of the Euro? Eurozone inflation data, measured by the Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), is an important econometric for the Euro. If inflation rises more than expected, especially if above the ECB’s 2% target, it obliges the ECB to raise interest rates to bring it back under control. Relatively high interest rates compared to its counterparts will usually benefit the Euro, as it makes the region more attractive as a place for global investors to park their money. How does economic data influence the value of the Euro? Data releases gauge the health of the economy and can impact on the Euro. Indicators such as GDP, Manufacturing and Services PMIs, employment, and consumer sentiment surveys can all influence the direction of the single currency. A strong economy is good for the Euro. Not only does it attract more foreign investment but it may encourage the ECB to put up interest rates, which will directly strengthen the Euro. Otherwise, if economic data is weak, the Euro is likely to fall. Economic data for the four largest economies in the euro area (Germany, France, Italy and Spain) are especially significant, as they account for 75% of the Eurozone’s economy. How does the Trade Balance impact the Euro? Another significant data release for the Euro is the Trade Balance. This indicator measures the difference between what a country earns from its exports and what it spends on imports over a given period. If a country produces highly sought after exports then its currency will gain in value purely from the extra demand created from foreign buyers seeking to purchase these goods. Therefore, a positive net Trade Balance strengthens a currency and vice versa for a negative balance.\n\n\n\n",

        "text":"EUR\/USD Current price: 1.1428\n\nTrade war retakes centre stage as the August 1 deadline looms.\n\nGerman inflation unexpectedly ticked higher in June.\n\nEUR\/USD aims to resume its slide and pierce the 1.1400 mark.\n\nThe EUR\/USD pair bottomed at 1.1401 on Wednesday, as the US Dollar (USD) surged on the back of solid United States (US) data and a mostly hawkish Federal Reserve (Fed) monetary policy decision.\n\nThe US economy grew at a faster-than-anticipated pace in the second quarter of the year, according to the preliminary estimate of the Q2 Gross Domestic Product (GDP), which rose by 3% after declining by 0.5% in the first quarter of the year. Even further, the ADP Employment Change report showed that the private sector added 104K new job positions in July, beating the 78K expected and improving from the -23K posted in June.\n\nThe Fed kept interest rates on hold, as widely anticipated, and showed no rush to trim interest rates, despite constant pressure from US President Donald Trump. Generally speaking, the central bank delivered a hawkish message, further boosting demand for the USD.\n\nMeanwhile, the looming August 1 deadline on tariffs undermines the mood. The White House announced tariffs on Brazil and imports of semi-finished copper products and copper-intensive derivative products on Wednesday.\n\nEarly on Thursday, Germany released the preliminary estimate of the July Consumer Price Index (CPI), which rose 0.3% in the month and 2% from a year earlier, above the 0.2% and 1.9% expected. As for the US, the country reported that the core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index was up 2.8% YoY in June, matching May’s reading. Finally, weekly unemployment claims were up by 218K, better than the 224K anticipated by market players.\n\nEUR\/USD short-term technical outlook\n\nThe EUR\/USD pair corrected modestly higher from its intraday low, but met sellers around 1.1460, currently hovering around the 1.1430 level. Technical readings in the daily chart show that the risk remains skewed to the downside, as technical indicators consolidate near their recent lows well into negative territory. Even further, the 20 Simple Moving Average (SMA) accelerated south above the current level, standing at around 1.1650.\n\nIn the near term, the EUR\/USD pair is poised to extend its slide. The 4-hour chart shows technical indicators are resuming their slides within negative levels, after correcting extreme oversold conditions. At the same time, an almost vertical 20 SMA collapsed below the 100 and 200 SMAs, reflecting sellers’ dominance.\n\nSupport levels: 1.1400 1.1360 1.1325\n\nResistance levels: 1.1470 1.1510 1.1555",
