        "text":"What do ‘long’ and ‘short’ mean in spread betting?\n\nGoing long is the term used to describe placing a bet that the market price will increase over a certain timeframe. Going short or ‘shorting’ a market is the reverse – placing a bet that the market will decline.\n\nSo spread betting enables you to speculate on both rising and falling markets. You would buy the market to go long, or sell the market to go short.\n\nLet’s say you thought the price of gold was going to decline. You could open a spread bet to ‘sell’ the underlying market. The loss or gain to your position would depend on the extent to which your prediction was correct. If the market did decline, your spread bet would profit. But if the price of gold increased instead, your position would make a loss.",

        "text":"What is CFD trading?\n\nCFD trading is the method of speculating on the underlying price of an asset – like shares, indices, commodities, forex and more – on a trading platform like ours.\n\nA CFD – short for ‘contract for difference’ – is the type of derivative that enables you to trade the price movements of these financial markets with us. With this form of trading, you don’t own the underlying asset – you’re only getting exposure to its price movements.\n\nWe offer over 15,000+ markets for you to speculate on with CFDs, including shares, indices, forex, commodities and more. Ready to trade CFDs? Practise on a demo, or open an account to get started.\n\nSome of the key characteristics of CFDs and CFD trading are explained in more detail below.",

        "text":"Get immediate exposure to an entire index\n\nA primary advantage of trading indices using derivatives like spread bets and CFDs is the sheer breadth of market exposure accessed in a single position.\n\nIndices, as a representation of an entire market or industry, measure the overall performance of all stocks included within the index. For example, let’s say a notable event occurs that affects the market as a whole rather than just a few specific companies. By taking a position on an index like the S&P 500, you trade on how the incident will impact a wide cross-section of the most important stocks in an economy or sector.\n\nWhen you trade an index in this way, you also take your position at the exact price of the market at the time you trade, minus any charges incurred.\n\nTo gain a similar level of exposure through traditional investments, you’d have to incur the time and monetary costs of purchasing the individual shares making up the index, or invest in an exchange traded fund (ETF), which would be priced according to the fund's net asset value.\n\nSimply put, indices trading is an immediate and direct way to trade on the movements of the total market at its current price.",

        "text":"Understanding VIX values\n\nVolatility is a measure of the movement of an asset’s price, rather than the price of the asset. When you trade volatility, you aren’t focused on the direction of change, but how much and how frequently the market has moved. This is why VIX values are quoted as percentage points.\n\nFor the past several years, if the VIX was trading below 20 then the market was considered to be in a period of stability, while levels of 30 or more indicated high volatility. Still, remember, trading volatility is not trading a market downturn, as it is possible for the market to decline but volatility remain low.\n\nThere is a strong negative correlation between the VIX and stock market returns. If the VIX moves up, it is likely that the S&P 500 is falling in price. If the volatility index declines, then the S&P 500 is likely to be experiencing stability. The VIX is thought to predict tops and bottoms in the SPX. There is even a mantra that states: ‘when the VIX is high, it’s time to buy. When the VIX is low, look out below’.\n\nWhen you trade the VIX, you aren’t trading an asset directly because there is no physical asset to buy or sell. Instead, with us, you can use spread bets and CFDs to take a position on the movement of the VIX, as well as VIX futures and exchange traded funds (ETFs).\n\nOn our side, we price our cash Volatility Index (VIX) contracts in a different way to the rest of our cash index markets. Rather than aiming to replicate the underlying index price, we follow the method used to derive our undated commodity prices. This means that there is a difference between our undated price and the underlying index price on these markets.",

Both are financial derivatives, which means that you never take ownership of any underlying assets.\n\nInstead, you’ll speculate exclusively on the underlying asset’s price movements – in this case, either fluctuations in the index level of the FTSE 100, or movements in the prices of FTSE 100 ETFs or shares.\n\nWhen investing in the FTSE 100, on the other hand, you’ll do so via our share dealing platform. This means that you’ll buy and own actual assets – for example, shares in a FTSE 100-tracking ETF or FTSE 100-constituent company. Because you’ll be a shareholder, you’re entitled to dividends if any are paid, and granted voting rights if applicable.",
